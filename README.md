# angular-brunch-seed
### A started project for AngularJS using Brunch.io

[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) + [Brunch](http://brunch.io)

Features:
* Coffeescript / Jade / Less / SASS / SCSS / Stylus automatically compiled on save
* auto-reload during development saves you from manually refreshing the page
* Javascript / CSS minification for production
* [testacular](https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular) integration for
  unit tests
* Bootstrap integration with themes.

## How to use angular-brunch-seed

* `git clone https://github.com/scotch/angular-brunch-seed.git` to clone the **angular-brunch-seed** repository
* `cd angular-brunch-seed`
* `./scripts/init.sh` to install node packages

or if you have **Brunch** installed run:

`brunch new myapp --skeleton https://github.com/scotch/angular-brunch-seed`

### Running the app during development

* `./scripts/server.sh` to serve using **Brunch**

Then navigate your browser to [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)

### Running the app in production

* `./scripts/production.sh` to minify javascript and css files.

### Running unit tests

* `./scripts/test.sh` to run unit test with [testacular](https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular)
* Open the browser you would like to test to [http://localhost:3334](http://localhost:3334)

Notes:

- If you would like to write your test in coffeescript run `./scripts/compile-tests.sh` in a 
seperate window.
- Testacular will run tests on save. To insure that changes are
saved be sure to have `./script/server.sh` or `./script/development.sh` running in the console.
- If you are on OS X you set the browsers that you would like to target
  in the `/test/testacular_conf.js` file E.g. `browser = ["ChromeCanary", "Firefox"]`

### End to end testing

WIP

### Common issues

`EMFILE` error
- EMFILE means there're too many open files. Brunch watches all your project files and it's usually a pretty big number. You can fix this error with setting max opened file count to bigger number with command ulimit -n <number> (10000 should be enough).

### Receiving updates from upstream

When we upgrade angular-seed's repo with newer angular or testing library code, you can just
fetch the changes and merge them into your project with git.

`git pull origin master`
