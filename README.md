# angular-brunch-seed
### A starter project for AngularJS using Brunch.io

[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) + [Brunch](http://brunch.io)

Features:
* Coffeescript / Jade / Less / SASS / SCSS / Stylus automatically compiled on save
* auto-reload during development saves you from manually refreshing the page
* Javascript / CSS minification for production
* [testacular](https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular) integration for
  unit tests
* Bootstrap integration with themes.

## How to use angular-brunch-seed

* `git clone https://github.com/scotch/angular-brunch-seed.git` to clone the **angular-brunch-seed** repository
* `cd angular-brunch-seed`
* `./scripts/init.sh` to install node packages

or if you have **Brunch** installed run:

`brunch new myapp --skeleton https://github.com/scotch/angular-brunch-seed`


### Using Jade

You will find the jade files in the `app` and `app/partials` directories. Upon save the Jade files will be compiled to HTML
and placed in the `app/assets` folder. Do not modify the files in the `app/assets` folder as they will be overriden with subsequent
changes to their `*.jade` counter part.

### Using html

By default angular-brunch-seed uses jade templates. If you would prefer to use HTML run the command:

```
./scripts/compile-html.sh
```
All Jade file will be compiled to HTML and be placed in the `app/assets` directory. Addtionally, the `*.jade`
files will be removed from the project. Any changes that you make to the `app/assets/**/*.html` files will now appear in the
browser.

### Running the app during development

* `./scripts/server.sh` to serve using **Brunch**

Then navigate your browser to [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)

### Running the app in production

* `./scripts/production.sh` to minify javascript and css files.

### Running unit tests

* `./scripts/test.sh` to run unit test with [testacular](https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular)
* Open the browser you would like to test to [http://localhost:3334](http://localhost:3334)

Notes:

- If you would like to write your test in coffeescript run `./scripts/compile-tests.sh` in a 
seperate window.
- Testacular will run tests on save. To insure that changes are
saved be sure to have `./script/server.sh` or `./script/development.sh` running in the console.
- If you are on OS X you set the browsers that you would like to target
  in the `/test/testacular_conf.js` file E.g. `browser = ["ChromeCanary", "Firefox"]`

### End to end testing

WIP

### Common issues

`EMFILE` error
- EMFILE means there're too many open files. Brunch watches all your project files and it's usually a pretty big number. You can fix this error with setting max opened file count to bigger number with command ulimit -n <number> (10000 should be enough).

### Receiving updates from upstream

When we upgrade angular-seed's repo with newer angular or testing library code, you can just
fetch the changes and merge them into your project with git.

`git pull origin master`

## Directory Layout

    _public/                  --> Contains generated file for servering the app
                                  These files should not be edited directly
    app/                      --> all of the files to be used in production

      assets                  --> a place for static assets. These files will be copied to
                                  the public directory un-modified.
        font/                 --> [fontawesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) rendering icons

        partials/             --> angular view partials (partial HTML templates)
          nav.html                If you are using HTML you may modify these files directly.

      partials/               --> Jade partial files. This file will be converted to HTML upon save.
        nav.jade              If you are using HTML this directory will not be present. You will find the template file
        partial1.jade         in the `app/assets/partials` directory instead.
        partial2.jade         If you are using Jade these file will be converted to HTML and copied to `app/assets/partials` upon save.
